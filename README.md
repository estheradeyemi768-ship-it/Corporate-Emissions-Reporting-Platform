# 🌍 Corporate Emissions Reporting Platform

Welcome to a transparent, blockchain-powered solution for corporate emissions reporting! This Web3 project tackles the real-world problem of inaccurate, opaque, and manipulable emissions data from corporations, which hinders global efforts to combat climate change. By leveraging the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts, it automates reporting, audits, and penalties for non-compliance, ensuring immutable records, verifiable compliance, and incentivized accuracy. Governments, regulators, and stakeholders can trust the data, while companies benefit from streamlined processes and potential rewards for green practices.

## ✨ Features

📊 Automated emissions reporting with immutable on-chain storage  
🔍 Real-time automated audits using predefined compliance rules  
💰 Penalty enforcement via smart contract deductions (e.g., from escrowed funds or tokens)  
🏆 Rewards for compliant and low-emission companies (e.g., tokenized incentives)  
📈 Dashboard-like queries for regulators to view aggregated data  
⚖️ Dispute resolution mechanism for contested reports  
🔒 Secure registration and role-based access for companies, auditors, and regulators  
🌐 Integration with oracles for external data (e.g., emission standards or real-world sensors)  
📉 Trend analysis and historical tracking of emissions over time  
🚫 Prevention of fraudulent submissions through hashing and verification

## 🛠 How It Works

This platform consists of 8 interconnected Clarity smart contracts, each handling a specific aspect of the emissions reporting lifecycle. Data is submitted as hashed reports (e.g., using SHA-256 for privacy), audited automatically, and enforced with penalties or rewards. All transactions are on the Stacks blockchain for transparency and immutability.

### Key Smart Contracts

1. **Registry Contract**: Manages user registration. Companies, auditors, and regulators register with their STX addresses, roles, and verification details. Prevents unauthorized access.  
   - Functions: `register-user`, `get-user-role`, `update-user-info`.

2. **Reporting Contract**: Allows companies to submit emissions data (e.g., CO2 metrics, hashed reports). Timestamps submissions and stores metadata.  
   - Functions: `submit-report`, `get-report-details`, `list-company-reports`.

3. **Standards Contract**: Stores and updates emission compliance standards (e.g., thresholds per industry). Governed by regulators.  
   - Functions: `set-standard`, `get-standard-for-industry`, `update-threshold`.

4. **Audit Contract**: Automates audits by comparing submitted reports against standards. Flags non-compliance and triggers penalties.  
   - Functions: `perform-audit`, `get-audit-result`, `batch-audit`.

5. **Penalty Contract**: Calculates and enforces penalties for non-compliance (e.g., deducts from escrowed STX or tokens). Handles payment to a regulatory fund.  
   - Functions: `calculate-penalty`, `enforce-penalty`, `get-penalty-history`.

6. **Rewards Contract**: Issues rewards (e.g., custom tokens) to compliant companies based on audit results. Encourages low emissions.  
   - Functions: `issue-reward`, `claim-reward`, `get-reward-balance`.

7. **Dispute Contract**: Enables companies to dispute audit results. Involves auditors for resolution and updates records accordingly.  
   - Functions: `file-dispute`, `resolve-dispute`, `get-dispute-status`.

8. **Oracle Integration Contract**: Fetches external data (e.g., via trusted oracles) for real-time factors like carbon prices or sensor data. Validates and feeds into audits.  
   - Functions: `request-oracle-data`, `validate-oracle-response`, `get-oracle-value`.

**For Companies**  
- Register via the Registry Contract.  
- Submit hashed emissions data quarterly using the Reporting Contract.  
- The Audit Contract automatically checks compliance against the Standards Contract.  
- If non-compliant, the Penalty Contract deducts funds; if compliant, earn rewards via the Rewards Contract.  
- Dispute any issues through the Dispute Contract.

**For Regulators/Auditors**  
- Set and update standards in the Standards Contract.  
- Query reports and audits for oversight.  
- Resolve disputes and monitor penalties/rewards.  
- Use oracle data for dynamic adjustments.

**For Everyone**  
- Verify any report's authenticity and audit trail on-chain.  
- No central authority—everything is decentralized and auditable.

This setup solves real-world issues like greenwashing and regulatory bottlenecks by making emissions data tamper-proof and enforcement automated. Deploy on Stacks testnet for prototyping! 🚀
